# KickstarterAnalysis
Kickstarter campaign analysis in Microsoft Excel - with graphs

## Three conclusions that I came to when thinking about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data:

a. It appears as though there were more campaigns that started in the spring and summertime,
and there was a steady decline of campaigns after the summer and rising again towards the
holiday season at the end of the year.

b. There was a higher chance of success when asking for smaller amounts of money.

c. Overall, campaigns involving theater - specifically plays - were the most popular and showed the
highest rate of success.

## Limitations of this dataset:

It doesn’t show the marketing budget or exposure created by the campaign starters, so it could lead to a
false idea or expectation of success/failure based solely on the general information provided.

## Other possible tables/graphs that I'd like to add:

I would like to create a chart showing the overall asking amount for theater projects to see if they had
lower values overall, thus increasing their chance of success over other categories. At the moment, it
shows only that there was a much larger amount overall, which could be the reason for the amount of
seemingly successful campaigns.

I would also like to create a pivot table and a chart to show if staff picks had a higher rate of success
overall and see if there might be a bias towards a certain category among the Kickstarter staff.

Another bit of information that I’d be interested in graphing would be to see if the campaign donation
amount that was requested by the campaign starters was higher/lower during certain months.
